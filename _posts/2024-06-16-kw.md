## Working with KW
I started using KWorkflow pretty late into my kernel dev adventure, so I didn't really use most advanced features. It was however very useful as a tool to speed up the development process as instead of using complex commands I could just ```kw build``` and go do something else (and ```kw mail``` was also a great tool). I had some urgent projects that I had to work on while this one was going on, so I couldn't give it all the attention I wanted to, but I do think I made an extremely useful contibution to the project, even if it wasn't related to code.

## A personal issue
When I was setting up kworkflow, I had a few issues, but one was far and ahead the most confusing: I wanted to setup my enviroment to be arm64 and also setup my remote and so on, and when I looked through the *man* pages and documentation website for kw everything was telling me to add these configurations to a **kworkflow.config** file that... didn't do anything. I attempted to use the ```kw config``` command and it told me that that file was part of a deprecated system for configuration management that they'd phased out already, so I went looking through the documentation and found that a few pages did have some references to the new config system, which used separate files for each command in a ```.kw``` folder, for example ```.kw/build.config``` for the configurations related to ```kw build```. After messing around with that a bit, I managed to get my setup working. It annoyed me, though, that the documentation was contradicting itself to the point of actively getting in the way of setting up the program. 

## Documentation work
Because of the difficulties I faced when setting up, I decided to contribute to the project by rewriting
